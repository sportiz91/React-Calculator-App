## Learnings

1. More practice into React useState, useEffect & components.
1. CSS: more practice into Grid System. Pretty comfy using this style of layout by now.
1. Infraestructure: more practice into Git, MarkDown & hosting into Heroku.
1. Learnt about different use cases for "?" keyword. More specifically:

   - Ternary operator
   - Optional Chaining -> in this App we use Optional Chaining because we have a function `equals()` that gets called under certain conditions and can be triggered by an event listener too. In the case that the function is executed instead of triggered, then we would have an error. With `?` we can save this scenario.
   - Nullish Coalescing

1. Learnt about NumberFormat library. Please checkout: [NumberFormat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format).
